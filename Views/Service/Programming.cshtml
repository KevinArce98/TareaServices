    <p class="lead col-md-6">Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an
         original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves 
         activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements
         f algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred 
         to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more 
         programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate
          performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires
           expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms,
            and formal logic.
     Related tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, 
     and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part
      of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the 
      term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code. 
      Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.</p>
